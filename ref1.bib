abstract = {In the past eight years of Bitcoin's history, the economy has seen the price of Bitcoin rapidly grow due to its promising outlook on the future for crypto currencies. Investors have taken note of several advantages Bitcoin provides over the traditional banking system. One such trait is that Bitcoin allows for decentralized banking, meaning that Bitcoin cannot be regulated by powerful banks. There is also a market cap of 21 million Bitcoins that can be in circulation, therefore a surplus of Bitcoins cannot be “printed” which would result in inflation. Bitcoin resolves the issue with transaction security by using a block chain, or a ledger, which records the history of every transaction ever made into one long hexadecimal “chain” of anonymous transactions, which keeps transaction history transparent, but also confidential. Bitcoin as a result has become a very bullish investing opportunity, and due to the huge volatility of the Bitcoin market price, this paper attempts to aid in investment decision making by providing Bitcoin market price prediction. Our team explored several Machine Learning algorithms by using Supervised Learning to train a prediction model and provide informative analysis of future market prices. We start with Linear Regression models, and train on several important features, then We proceed with the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells. All code is written in Python using Google's Tensor Flow software library. We show that the price of Bitcoin can be predicted with Machine Learning with high degree of accuracy.},

abstract = {In this project, we attempt to apply machine-learning algorithms to predict Bitcoin price. For the first phase of our investigation, we aimed to understand and better identify daily trends in the Bitcoin market while gaining insight into optimal features surrounding Bitcoin price. Our data set consists of over 25 features relating to the Bitcoin price and payment network over the course of five years, recorded daily. Using this information we were able to predict the sign of the daily price change with an accuracy of 98.7{\%}. For the second phase of our investigation, we focused on the Bitcoin price data alone and leveraged data at 10-minute and 10-second interval timepoints, as we saw an opportunity to evaluate price predictions at varying levels of granularity and noisiness. By predicting the sign of the future change in price, we are modeling the price prediction problem as a binomial classification task, experimenting with a custom algorithm that leverages both random forests and generalized linear models. These results had 50-55{\%} accuracy in predicting the sign of future price change using 10 minute time intervals.},

abstract = {Machine Learning is part of Artificial Intelligence that has the ability to make future forecastings based on the previous experience. Methods has been proposed to construct models including machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Learning. This paper presents a comparative performance of Machine Learning algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting. Specifically, this paper concentrates on forecasting of time series data. SVM has several advantages over the other models in forecasting, and previous research revealed that SVM provides a result that is almost or close to actual result yet also improve the accuracy of the result itself. However, recent research has showed that due to small range of samples and data manipulation by inadequate evidence and professional analyzers, overall status and accuracy rate of the forecasting needs to be improved in further studies. Thus, advanced research on the accuracy rate of the forecasted price has to be done.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is the world's leading cryptocurrency, allowing users to make transactions securely and anonymously over the Internet. In recent years, The Bitcoin the ecosystem has gained the attention of consumers, businesses, investors and speculators alike. While there has been significant research done to analyze the network topology of the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network's influence on overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of blockchain network-based features on the future price of Bitcoin. As a result of blockchain-network-based feature engineering and machine learning optimization, we obtain up-down Bitcoin price movement classification accuracy of roughly 55{\%}.},

@article{Uras2020,
abstract = {This paper studies how to forecast daily closing price series of Bitcoin, using data on prices and volumes of prior days. Bitcoin price behaviour is still largely unexplored, presenting new opportunities. We compared our results with two modern works on Bitcoin prices forecasting and with a well-known recent paper that uses Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily NASDAQ closing prices spanning a 3-year interval. We followed different approaches in parallel, implementing both statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. The SLR model for univariate series forecast uses only closing prices, whereas the MLR model for multivariate series uses both price and volume data. We applied the ADF-Test to these series, which resulted to be indistinguishable from a random walk. We also used two artificial neu-ral networks: MLP and LSTM. We then partitioned the dataset into shorter sequences, representing different price "regimes", obtaining best result using more than one previous price, thus confirming our regime hypothesis. All the models were evaluated in terms of MAPE and relativeRMSE. They performed well, and were overall better than those obtained in the benchmarks. Based on the results, it was possible to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology and its contribution to the state-of-the-art.},

Because the cryptocurrency market being relatively new when compared to traditional markets such as stocks, foreign exchange, and gold, there is a significant lack of studies in regard to predicting its price behavior. This research is interested in evaluating a number of regression-based algorithms in predicting the price of the Bitcoin (BTC) against United States Dollar (USD). Among the algorithms that will be investigated include the Linear Regression (LR), Neural Network Regression (NNR), Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR), and Boosted Decision Tree Regression (BDTR). By applying such regression-based analysis algorithms, the findings f should further help document the behavior of such a brand new, challenging yet extremely lucrative market.},
